# HomeAutomationApp
In our project, We used Thingspeak IoT cloud to control the appliances(Bulb , Fan) using the API keys .
We linked each button with different API keys (for example, Bulb On and Bulb Off).
If you have API keys and want to trigger those, you can replace the API keys with yours.
In the Menu, you can make the changes like update your college name, teammates, guide .
